PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project aims at developing Neural Networks using OpenCL on Xilinx FPGA.
This code serves as benchmark for researchers to implement their changes and compare their networks/enhancements.

The neural network implemented is as below:
	1. Cifarnet

This code is developed as a part of the Master's Project(2018) for the department of Computer Engineering under the 
guidance of Professor Hyeran Jeon.


PROJECT ARCHITECTURE:
Hardware: Xilinx FPGA (Adapted for Pynq and ZC706)
Programming Languages: OpenCL, C
Software Tools: Vivado HLS, Vivado and Xilinx SDK
